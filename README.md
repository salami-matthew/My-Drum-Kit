# My-Drum-Kit
This is my version of a drum kit made for a challenge from Angela Yu's Udemy course using html, CSS and JS
Through this challenge, I used my knowledge of html and css to create a simple design.
I was also able to learn about the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to select html elements using javascript.
Using javascript, I was able to add eventListeners as well as audio to the buttons to create the actual functional drumkit.
